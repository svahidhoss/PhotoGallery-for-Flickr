# Photo Galley for Flickr

In this repo I developed a Flickr client application that downloads and displays photos from Flickr's public feed.
Technologies Used: Kotlin, Android SDK, RecyclerView, Picasso, WorkManager.
Key Features:

- Background Work: Implemented background tasks using WorkManager to fetch data from Flickr.
- Networking: Utilized Retrofit for making API calls to Flickr's web service.
- Image Loading: Integrated Picasso library for efficient image loading and caching.
- RecyclerView: Displayed fetched images in a RecyclerView for a smooth and scrollable user experience.


Paging library here is not being used in this repo unlike the other repo that started the project from scratch.
